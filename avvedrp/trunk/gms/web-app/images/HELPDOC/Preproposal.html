<h3><a name="_Toc282523870" id="_Toc282523870">Adding new users - reviewers:</a></h3>
<p>A new role &ldquo;<strong>Reviewer</strong>&rdquo; has been added to GMS. The reviewers can be added by the  Administrator through <strong><em>Add User</em></strong> page and the role can also  be assigned here.The reviewers created are displayed  in the <strong><em>User List. </em></strong></p>
<p>The privileges for the role  &ldquo;reviewer can be saved in the <strong><em>Access Permission </em></strong>page. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc282523871" id="_Toc282523871">Creating approval Authorities:</a></h3>
<p>On the left menu panel, the  administrator clicks on <strong><em>Approval Authority</em></strong> menu. It expands  to display the sub menu &ndash; <strong><em>Add Approval Authority</em></strong> <br />
  On clicking <strong><em>Add Approval Authority</em></strong>,  the page below opens up. Here each group of approving persons at the  institution is registered. Further, for each approval authority, the members  are also added.</p>
<p>The fields bordered in red are  mandatory.<br />
The personal details are: <strong>Name</strong> of the group, group <strong>e-mail ID</strong> and Institution. Further, the <strong>Approve Mandatory</strong> field decides if  the particular group&rsquo;s approval is mandatory and it is set to &ldquo;Y&rdquo; (Yes) by  default. <strong>View All</strong> is set to &ldquo;Y&rdquo;  (Yes) by default which indicates that the members of this group are privileged  to view all proposals even if they don&rsquo;t get to review them. Setting a group  inactive here will result in removing the group from all user options. It is  then deemed to be non-existing.<br />
In the Approval Authority List, for  each line item (approval authority) , clicking on <strong><em>Add</em></strong><em> <strong>Members</strong></em> opens the page where members can be added to/removed from each Approval authority. The  existing reviewers are displayed in the table on the right (faculty) from which  selection can be made. </p>

<h3><a name="_Toc282523873" id="_Toc282523873">Add Proposal Category</a></h3>
<p>The Admin has to save the various  proposal categories in the GMS application for users (staff) to select from  while creating their proposals. Examples for category are Research, e-content,  infrastructure, network etc. This is done in the <strong><em>Master</em></strong>s module, sub menu  &ndash; <strong><em>Proposal  Category</em></strong></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc282523874" id="_Toc282523874">Submission of Pre-proposal by staff members</a></h2>
<p>The staff includes those users who  submit pre-proposals /proposals for evaluation. The Staff logs into the  application to create and submit pre-proposals to own institution for review.  After logging in, user clicks <strong><em>Pre proposal</em></strong> Menu on the left panel  and then clicks <strong><em>Add New Proposal</em></strong>.  </p>
<p>On clicking <strong><em>Create</em></strong>, the institution&rsquo;s  pre-proposal application form is opened for the Staff to fill up the  pre-proposal details:</p>
<p>After filling in the details, on  clicking <strong><em>Create</em></strong>, the user is given options to &ndash; <strong><em>save</em></strong> the document as  draft or to <strong><em>submit </em></strong>to authorities for review. </p>
<p>The <em><strong>Pre proposal status list </strong></em>displays the specific Staff&lsquo;s  list of pre-proposals which have been submitted so far and their status. &lsquo;<strong><em>Reviewing</em></strong>&rdquo;  status indicates that the pre-proposal submitted is under review. If the user  had chosen to save as draft then this field would have displayed &ldquo;Saved&rdquo;. </p>

When in &ldquo;Reviewing&rdquo; status,  clicking on &ldquo;<strong><em>Reviewing</em></strong>&rdquo; will open the page, where the details of the reviewing process for the particular pre proposal is given </p>
<p>Once the admin assigns the  pre-proposal to the approval authorities, sets the start order, restart order  etc, those details are shown here. Before this is done the page simply displays message - &quot;No Details&quot; <br />
This process is described below:</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc282523875" id="_Toc282523875">Proposal Authority Mapping</a></h2>
<p>The admin logs in the system and on  the left menu panel, clicks <strong><em>Proposal Authority map</em></strong>. When the  menu expands, the admin clicks on <strong><em>Assign proposal to approval authority</em></strong> sub menu. </p>
<p>The details can also be edited at a  later time. </p>
<p>Once the admin  saves the above details, the pre-proposal details get populated for each member  of the approval authorities to whom the specific pre-proposal was assigned. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc282523876" id="_Toc282523876">Pre &ndash; proposal Review</a></h2>
<p>The reviewer log  in, clicks <strong><em>Pre proposal</em></strong> menu on the left and when the menu expands, clicks <strong><em>Pre  proposal Approval</em></strong>.&nbsp; The list of  proposals to be reviewed by this reviewer at various evaluation levels is  displayed here. </p>
<p>If, for a  particular pre-proposal, this reviewer belongs to the approval authority of the  first level (Approve order &ndash; 1), then in the Approve /Reject column the  corresponding status will be &ldquo;<strong>Approve/Reject</strong>&rdquo;. On clicking this status label,  the pre-proposal is opened and the reviewer is provided with 3 buttons &ndash;  Accept, Need more info, Reject.<br />
But if the  reviewer belongs to any other authority level, then till the pre-proposal  passes through the other levels before his own, the status in the Approve /Reject  column will be &ldquo;View&rdquo; for this reviewer (and all others at this authority  level). On clicking <strong><em>View,</em></strong> the pre-proposal form can be opened and viewed only.</p>
<p>The reviewer has been provided with  a text area to input comments.<br />
Once a suitable status (<strong>Approved</strong>)  is selected, the line item disappears from the specific reviewer&rsquo;s list and the  line item populates the reviewers&rsquo; lists at the next authority level. <br />
If &ldquo;<strong>Need more info</strong>&rdquo; status is  selected then the line item returns to the Staff&rsquo;s list.&nbsp; The Staff can resubmit after adding the  required details and the chain now follows the Process Restart order. </p>
<p> The reviewer can view the proposals  he has reviewed in the past on a different page:</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the staff person can  track the review status in his log in, in the <strong><em>Pre Proposal List</em></strong>.</p>
