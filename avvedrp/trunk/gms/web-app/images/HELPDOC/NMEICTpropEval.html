<h3><a name="_Toc285816214" id="_Toc285816214">Initial  Administrative Functions</a></h3>
<a name="_Toc285816215" id="_Toc285816215"><strong>Site  Admin: Add New Role &ndash; ROLE_PROPOSALADMIN</strong></a>
<p>If not already  saved in the application, this role needs to be saved and assigned to the user  who needs to receive all evaluations from all the reviewers. Only a single  person in an institute may be assigned this role. (In future the role may be  assigned to each grant scheme for which proposals are called.). </p>
<a name="_Toc285816216" id="_Toc285816216"><strong>Site  Admin &ndash; Default approval authority</strong></a>
<p>Default approval authority must be  assigned for the institution. In this way, proposals submitted for all  notifications will be directly sent for review to the members of the default  approval authority. There can be only one default authority per institution.</p>
<a name="_Toc285816217" id="_Toc285816217"><strong>Site Admin &ndash; Notification creation for a grant  scheme</strong></a>
<p>In <strong>Call for Proposal</strong> sub menu of <strong>Projects </strong>Menu, the site administrator creates a new notification. Please note that  in this document we are explaining the process for publically solicited  proposals. So the notifications created are assigned the attribute &ldquo;Public &ndash;  Yes&rdquo;. This means that the notification gets displayed in a Notification List  made available outside the MGMS application as well. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc285816218" id="_Toc285816218">Proposal  Admin - Proposal evaluation Pre-settings</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned  before, the proposal administrator is in charge of various managing the  evaluation process. For each grant notification created and published by an  institution, the proposal admin assigns the specific evaluation parameters; ratings  required and prepare the questionnaire for use by the reviewers. </p>
<p>After  logging in, the user clicks on menu <strong>Proposal  evaluation &ndash; pre settings</strong>, and sub menu <strong>Eval scale</strong>. Here the user can create a new evaluation scale as well  as view all the scales created in this institution till now. <strong>Edit</strong> option is also provided to modify  any existing scale&rsquo;s name </p>
<p>After naming the  scale, the user clicks <strong>Eval Scale  Options</strong> where the standard scores can be listed. For e.g. if the reviewer  selects the option &ldquo;Good&rdquo; as per the Likert scale shown in the image below, for  a particular answer , then the asnswer has scored 3 marks.&nbsp; <br />
In case the user  wants to score in number format, a new scale can be defined where <strong>Scale option</strong> &ldquo;10&rdquo; can be assigned <strong>Scale option index</strong> &ldquo;10&rdquo; . </p>
<p>Once the scoring  pattern is decided, the user clicks on <strong>Eval  item</strong>, to add the criteria or questions for judging the proposals submitted  for a particular notification. <br />
As can be seen  below, 7 questions are assigned to the notification code &ldquo;NMEICT&rdquo; and the <strong>Eval Scale</strong> used will be &ldquo;Likert scale&rdquo;.</p>
<p>An applicant applies for the particular scheme by  clicking &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; for the notification. Currently, the same 7 page form  of IGNOU Sakshat has been made available for all institutions and  notifications. </p>
<p>On final  submission of the proposal, it is available for evaluating in the log-ins of  all reviewers who are part of the institution&rsquo;s default approval authority. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc285816220" id="_Toc285816220">Reviewer  &ndash; Proposal List</a></h3>
The  reviewers who belong to the default approval authority can see the proposal as  a line item in their <strong>Proposal List</strong>. 
On clicking <strong>View</strong>,  the preview page of the proposal is opened up.
<p>On clicking <strong>Review Proposal</strong>  for a  particular proposal, the  screen opens up where both the proposal as well as the review form are displayed. Top portion of  the screen displays the entire proposal in the preview format, and the bottom  half displays the questionnaire to be used for evaluation of the proposal. <strong>Maximize</strong> button has been provided for  both sections in case the user wishes to view the complete sections separately. <br />
  This was the questionnaire  created by the proposal administrator initially (Proposal  evaluation &ndash; pre settings). <br />
Please note that  there maybe n number of reviewers and so at any point of time, a score will be  displayed averaging the scores that have been assigned till then by one or more  reviewers. </p>
<p>Each reviewer puts the score as deemed fit for the  particular proposal and may enter any comments. It is mandatory that all  questions be answered. Clicking <strong>Save</strong> will just save the details as draft. On clicking <strong>Submit</strong>, the scores are officially submitted into the system for  calculation of the final score for the proposal.</p>
<p>The final rating of the proposal is  calculated as the average score. Currently, all reviewers can see the final  score and the number of votes cast which resulted in that final score. &ldquo;<strong>Votes cast</strong>&rdquo; is the number of reviewers  who have reviewed the proposal. <br />
The Proposal admin and Site admin  can also view the same list of scored proposals in the <strong>Projects</strong> menu, <strong>Call for  proposal</strong> sub-menu. In the <strong>Notification  List</strong>, clicking <strong>View</strong> in Proposal  column for a particular notification will open the page displaying the  proposals that were submitted against the notification and their final scores  at any point of time. </p>
