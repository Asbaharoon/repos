    Attachment types should be saved for specific document types so that they get displayed as options in associated modules. 
  The document types currently pre-set in MGMS are - Invoice, receipt, proposal, notification and project. For example, attachment types saved for document type Project will populate the   Attachment Type drop down menu in Sub project's attachment upload   screen.(Similarly, attachment types saved for document types Receipt, Invoice   etc will be displayed in the associated Expense Request screens.)</li>
</ul>
<ul class="style1">
  <li><strong>PI</strong>:  The list of all Principal Investigators at the Institution. (the PI will get  activated only when they click on the activation link which has sent to their  email id, entered during the creation of PI.</li>
