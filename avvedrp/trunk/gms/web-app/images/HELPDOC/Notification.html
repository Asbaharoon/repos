<p>For each grant scheme or any other funding opportunity , the grantor institution can publish the notification requesting for proposals along with the application form. <br />
  The  functionality provided allows the institution user to create a notification on  a wordpad and save alongside, the associated project, notification code,  notification date and last date for proposal submission. <br />
The related  application form can be uploaded here. </p>
<p>The Notification  List page lists out all the projects for which proposals have been requested by  the user&rsquo;s institution (grantor). From here, the grantor can do the following,  for each project:</p>
