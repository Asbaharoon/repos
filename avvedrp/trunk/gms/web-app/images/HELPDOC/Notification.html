<h2 class="style1"><a name="_Toc275266931" id="_Toc275266931">Notification</a> </h2>
<p class="style1">For each grant scheme or any other funding opportunity , the grantor institution can publish the notification requesting for proposals along with the application form. The Site Administrator and the Proposal Administrator have the privilege to create and publish notifications. <br />
</p>
<p class="style1">The user clicks on <em><strong>Projects</strong></em> tab, to expand the menu and then clicks <em><strong>Call For Proposal</strong></em>. Here, clicking on top row menu -<em><strong> New Notification</strong></em>, will open the page where new notification can be created. </p>
<p class="style1">The  functionality provided allows the institution user to create a notification on  a wordpad and save alongside, the associated notification name (grant), notification code,  notification date and last date for proposal submission. <br />
The related  application form can be uploaded here. </p>
<p class="style1">The <em><strong>Notification  List</strong></em> page lists out all the projects for which proposals have been requested by  the user&rsquo;s institution (grantor). From here, the grantor can do the following,  for each project:</p>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>View the application form</li>
  <li>Upload attachments</li>
  <li>Publish notification</li>
  <li>View proposals already submitted by interested       institutions</li>
  <li>Edit notification </li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">There is a special flag &quot;<strong>Public YesNo</strong>&quot; which has been set &quot;Y&quot; by default for any notification created in GMS. This indicates that the notification. along with the application form and other attachements are to be made available outside the GMS application, for the benefit of the common public. Anybody (not necessarily a user of GMS) may apply to the notification without  logging in. </p>
<p class="style1">In the GMS Log-in page, clicking on link <em><strong>Upload Proposal </strong></em>will display the <em><strong>Notification List </strong></em>for all institutions which are part of that GMS network Clicking on button Apply for any notification will open the correponding application form. </p>
<p class="style1">In case the flag has been set &quot;N&quot; then the particular notification is for private access and application only. Only GMS users of that network can view the notification in the internal Notification List - under tab <em><strong>Projects</strong></em>, sub menu - <strong><em>Proposal Management.</em> </strong></p>

<p class="style1">For each institution's privileged user, this section  lists out the (request-for-proposa)l notifications published by all the  institutions in the GMS for various projects.</p>
<p class="style1">On this page,  the interested institution users (prospective grantees) can:</p>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>View the notification title, code, notification date, grantor       institution&rsquo;s name, last date for submission of proposal etc. </li>
  <li>View the notification details</li>
  <li>Upload their proposal thereby setting a status       &ldquo;Submitted&rdquo; and then </li>
  <li>Apply for the grant scheme..</li>
</ul>
