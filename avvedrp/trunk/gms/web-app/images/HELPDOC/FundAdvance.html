<h2 class="style1">Fund Advance </h2>
<p class="style1">Advances may be given  to the project employees from the project fund to cover possible future  expenses &ndash; for e.g travel advance to attend a conference. Currently, it is not  possible record this advance but only any  expenses paid for in the various account heads. <br />
</p>
<p class="style1">In GMS Fund Advacne module,  you can  record the details of any advance paid for the Project.<br />
</p>
<p class="style1">Since advance fund is against grant allocation  the total expense and advance should be less than or equal to allocated amount  (i.e.&nbsp; allocatedAmount  &gt;=(totalExpense+FundAdvance))</p>
<p class="style1">From menu <em><strong>Expenses</strong></em>, select sub menu <em><strong>Fund Advance
  </strong></em></p>
<p class="style1">Mandatory details to be filled in are - Advance date &amp; amount, associated grant allocation and a short description, payment mode and payment details (check and bank details etc).</p>
<p class="style1">Click <em><strong>Create</strong></em> to save the details  </p>
<p class="style1">In the table  <em><strong>Advance Fund List</strong></em> below, the saved details are displayed in a line item. All such advances made for this project are displayed here as line items/rows.</p>
<p class="style1">Each row has two buttons - <em><strong>Edit</strong></em> and <em><strong>Enter Expense Details</strong> </em></p>
<ul class="style1">
  <li><em><strong>Edit</strong></em> - Any Advance information maybe updated here at a later time. But please note that the advance details are not editable once the first expense is entered against that advance. </li>
  <li><em><strong>Enter Expense Details</strong></em> - In the new screen, each expense detail can be entered for which payment came from the particular advance. You can enter multiple expenses at different times but only till  the advanced amount lasts. An expense for which the remaining fund is not sufficient will not be allowed to be recorded. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Please note that in
the Record Expenses screen (under Expenses menu), Current Balance amount displayed has all
such advances deducted since those amounts are not available for
utilizing.</span></p>
