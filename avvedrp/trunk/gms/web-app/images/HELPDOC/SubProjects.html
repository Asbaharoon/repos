<p class="style1"><strong>Create sub project</strong><br />
  The institution  can divide the main project into sub projects to be further assigned to self or other  institutions. Ideally, only the main project PI, co-PI and the institution's administrator can create sub projects. </p>
<p class="style1">After logging in to MGMS, in the <em><strong>Project List</strong></em> page, click on the name of the particular project. The project home is opened with default page showing the <em><strong>Project Info.</strong></em> Click on top row menu <em><strong>Allocation</strong></em> and further,click on the sub menu <em><strong>Sub allocate project. </strong></em></p>
<p class="style1">The <em><strong>Sub project Allotment</strong></em> screen is opened.  </p>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>The details saved of a sub project are: name, start       &amp; end dates, receiving institution, amount of allocation, sanction       order number (Letter no :), date of allocation and any remarks by the       user.</li>
  <li>Now the user&rsquo;s institution has become the &ldquo;Grantor&rdquo;       who has assigned a (sub) project and allocated an associated grant amount       to the receiving institution, the Grantee.</li>
  <li>What is categorized as &ldquo;sub project&rdquo; by the grantor       is categorized as &ldquo;project&rdquo; by the grantee</li>
  <li>Grant allocations may be made any number of times to       a grantee, for a project. </li>
  <li>The same project cannot be assigned to two/more       different institutions. </li>
  <li>(The system validates that sub-project start and end       date falls within the start and end date of the main project).</li>
  <li>After creating a subproject, any number of associated       documents may be uploaded into the GMS, for future reference.</li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">After creation of sub projects the grantee is connected to the sub project in the following manner throughout the life cycle of the sub project:</p>
<ul class="style1">
  <li><em><strong>Edit </strong></em>sub project details such as PI , Amount allocation, start/end dates etc</li>
  <li><em><strong>Transfer funds</strong></em> to the sub project from time to time against the allocation </li>
  <li>Upload <em><strong>Attachments</strong></em> relevant to the sub project </li>
  <li>If required, record the <em><strong>withdrawal</strong></em> of grants to the specific sub project - this means that the particular sub project will no longer be of interest for the grantor and there fore will not be financed from then on. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">In the Sub project List (bottom half of the allotment page) , each line item (sub project) has links to enable user to access the respective screens mentioned above. </p>
<p class="style1">The utiization reports submitted by the institutions undertaking the sub projects will be available in the Reports module and is therefore discussed in that section. </p>
