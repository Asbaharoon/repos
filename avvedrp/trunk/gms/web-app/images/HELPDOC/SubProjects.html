<h1><a name="_Toc275266914" id="_Toc275266914">Sub  project Allocation</a> </h1>
<p><strong>Create sub project</strong><br />
  The institution  can divide the main project into sub projects to be further assigned to other  institutions. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The details saved of a sub project are: name, start       &amp; end dates, receiving institution, amount of allocation, sanction       order number (Letter no :), date of allocation and any remarks by the       user.</li>
  <li>Now the user&rsquo;s institution has become the &ldquo;Grantor&rdquo;       who has assigned a (sub) project and allocated an associated grant amount       to the receiving institution, the Grantee.</li>
  <li>What is categorized as &ldquo;sub project&rdquo; by the grantor       is categorized as &ldquo;project&rdquo; by the grantee</li>
  <li>Grant allocations may be made any number of times to       a grantee, for a project. </li>
  <li>The same project cannot be assigned to two/more       different institutions. </li>
  <li>(The system validates that sub-project start and end       date falls within the start and end date of the main project).</li>
  <li>After creating a subproject, any number of associated       documents may be uploaded into the GMS, for future reference.</li>
</ul>
