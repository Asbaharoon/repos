<h2>Full proposal submission (Internal) </h2>
<h2><a name="_Toc282523869" id="_Toc282523869">Initial Administrative Functions</a></h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc282523870" id="_Toc282523870">Adding new users - reviewers:</a></h3>
<p>A new role &ldquo;<strong>Reviewer</strong>&rdquo; has been added to GMS. The reviewers can be added by the  Administrator through <strong><em>Add User</em></strong> page and the role can also  be assigned here.The reviewers created are displayed  in the <strong><em>User List. </em></strong></p>
<p>The privileges for the role  &ldquo;reviewer can be saved in the <strong><em>Access Permission </em></strong>page. </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc282523871" id="_Toc282523871">Creating approval Authorities:</a></h3>
<p>On the left menu panel, the  administrator clicks on <strong><em>Approval Authority</em></strong> menu. It expands  to display the sub menu &ndash; <strong><em>Add Approval Authority</em></strong> <br />
  On clicking <strong><em>Add Approval Authority</em></strong>,  the page  opens up where each group of approving persons at the  institution is registered. Further, for each approval authority, the members  are also added.</p>
<p>The fields bordered in red are  mandatory.<br />
The personal details are: <strong>Name</strong> of the group, group <strong>e-mail ID</strong> and Institution. Further, the <strong>Approve Mandatory</strong> field decides if  the particular group&rsquo;s approval is mandatory and it is set to &ldquo;Y&rdquo; (Yes) by  default. <strong>View All</strong> is set to &ldquo;Y&rdquo;  (Yes) by default which indicates that the members of this group are privileged  to view all proposals even if they don&rsquo;t get to review them. Setting a group  inactive here will result in removing the group from all user options. It is  then deemed to be non-existing.<br />
In the Approval Authority List, for  each line item (approval authority) , clicking on <strong><em>Add</em></strong><em> <strong>Members</strong></em> opens the page  below, where members can be added to/removed from each Approval authority. The  existing reviewers are displayed in the table on the right  from which  selection can be made. </p>
<p>In the <em><strong>Approval Authority List </strong></em>, for each line item (approval authority), clicking on <strong>Edit</strong>, opens the page  below, where any modification can be made. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc282523877" id="_Toc282523877">Submission of Full proposals by staff members</a> </h2>
<p>The approved pre-proposals details  also get automatically populated in the <strong><em>Full Proposal List</em></strong> for the Staff. </p>
<p>By clicking <strong><em>Submit Full proposal</em></strong> for  a line item here, the staff will open the proposal uploading page. The <em><strong>Full Proposal Status</strong></em> displays No Full Proposal for both  the line items indicating that proposals have not been uploaded yet. By  clicking <strong><em>Submit Full Proposal</em></strong> for each line item, screen  can be opened where the proposal can be uploaded and saved or  submitted (just as in the case of pre-proposal)</p>
<p>Once the proposals are submitted,  the status in <strong><em>Full Proposal List &ndash; Full Proposal Status</em></strong> column changes to <strong><em>Reviewing</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Here onwards the process is same as  that for pre-proposal. The admin maps the approval authorities for the  submitted full proposals and so the details get populated as lie items for the  various reviewers. </p>
<p>The approved full proposals are ready to be sent to external agencies and this submission is done by a privileged user. </p>
