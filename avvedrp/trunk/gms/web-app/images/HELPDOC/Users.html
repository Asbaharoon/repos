<h2><a name="_Toc275266926" id="_Toc275266926">Users, Roles &amp; Privileges </a></h2>
<p>The site administrator  adds all the other users for an institution. Then the users are assigned their roles which automatically assigns certain privileges to them and further, if required, the users are provided the privileges to specific projects.</p>
<p>To access these features, log in as the sie admin and on the left navigation bar, click <em><strong>Users</strong></em> to expand the menu. The following sub meus are then available.  </p>
<h3><a name="_Toc275266927" id="_Toc275266927"><em>Add  user</em></a></h3>
<p>Using this  functionality, the institution site admin can create any number of new users  for the GMS.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The details saved for this profile are &ndash; Full name,       password, email and role in the institution</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>A confirmation email with the activation link and       login details will be sent to the email address entered during registration.       &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Account will get activated by clicking the activation       link provided in the email. </li>
  <li>There is an option for the user to change the login       password. If the user forgets the password, the system will reset the       password and send it to the email entered by the user based on request.</li>
  <li>A user accessing the GMS using the login created by       an institution&rsquo;s site admin, will have privileges and permissions       corresponding to the role chosen and the access will also be only to that       particular institution&rsquo;s GMS. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc275266928" id="_Toc275266928"><em>Project  Permission</em></a></h3>
<p>Here, a new user  may be given access to a number of projects all at once, by simply selecting  the projects. <br />
  Once they are  selected, the user can view the list of projects he is privileged to view, when he logs into the GMS.</p>
<p>A few  ideal advisable permissions are given below:</p>
<p>
  <ol>
  As a PI or CoPI, a user should have visibility of all  the project for which 
  <ol>
  <ul>
    <li>User is PI or CoPI, and all the sub_projects  under these projects</li>
    <li>Should not have access to other projects under  the same Institute</li>
    <li>Should not have access to other projects under  the same department</li>
    <li>Should not have access to main_project if only  PI/CoPI for sub_project</li>
    <li>Should not have access to the sister  sub_projects for which not PI/CoPI</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc275266929" id="_Toc275266929"><em>Access  Permission</em></a></h3>
<p>This  functionality enables the site admin to create and customize sets of  privileges/privilege groups for each role created for the institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The advantage is that, when a role is chosen  for a new user, he is automatically &amp; immediately given permissions and  rights corresponding to the role.&nbsp; </p>
<h3><em>Role Privileges </em></h3>
<p>This is a  further provision to assign all of the privileges in the GMS to a specific role  (aside from that of site admin) , using a single click.</p>
