<h3><a name="_Toc275266927" id="_Toc275266927">Add  user</a></h3>
<p>Using this  functionality, the institution site admin can create any number of new users  for the GMS.</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The details saved for this profile are &ndash; Full name,       password, email and role in the institution</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>A confirmation email with the activation link and       login details will be sent to the email address entered during registration.       &nbsp;</li>
  <li>Account will get activated by clicking the activation       link provided in the email. </li>
  <li>There is an option for the user to change the login       password. If the user forgets the password, the system will reset the       password and send it to the email entered by the user based on request.</li>
  <li>A user accessing the GMS using the login created by       an institution&rsquo;s site admin, will have privileges and permissions       corresponding to the role chosen and the access will also be only to that       particular institution&rsquo;s GMS. </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="_Toc275266928" id="_Toc275266928">Project  Permission</a></h3>
<p>Here, a new user  may be given access to a number of projects all at once, by simply selecting  the projects. <br />
  Once they are  selected, the user can view his list of projects when he logs into the GMS.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc275266929" id="_Toc275266929">Access  Permission</a></h3>
<p>This  functionality enables the site admin to create and customize sets of  privileges/privilege groups for each role created for the institution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The advantage is that, when a role is chosen  for a new user, he is automatically &amp; immediately given permissions and  rights corresponding to the role.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There is a  further provision to assign all of the privileges in the GMS to a specific role  (aside from that of site admin) , using a single click.</p>
