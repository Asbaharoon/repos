<h2>Award Project </h2>
<p>Once all the received proposals are evaluated by the approval authority, the best of the lot are awarded projects i.e the grantor institute officially confirms that it will fund the projects as described in the winning proposals. This is applicable for each grant scheme notification issued by an institute.</p>
<p>Following are the salient features:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Projects       are awarded to own or other institutions&rsquo; PI (as mentioned in the proposal). </li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
  <li>It       is not necessary that the entire proposed project be accepted and so the       project title may vary from the proposal title. </li>
  <li>Immediate       essential details  captured as discrete data are&ndash; sanction order no: (a       unique official identifier) project start/end date, total amount       allocated. </li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
  <li>A       lot more details of the contract can be captured. Currently,  provision for attachment upload has been given. (Further       details are then captured such as Terms of the project, Fund allocation,       Standard Expense Heads, Frequency of fund Release, formats for progress       reports, formats for financial Reports, their frequency etc.) Document       type is Project and Attachment type &ndash; contract.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="1">
  <li>Multiple       projects can be awarded for a single notification.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6" type="1">
  <li>Projects       maybe awarded at different times over a period i.e. all winning projects       are not selected and awarded in a single session. (Even as a project is       happening, new proposals will be under evaluation, awarded etc). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<p>In GMS, currently it is possible for the proposal  administrator and site administrator to view the list of reviewed proposals for  each notification. Final score after evaluation by the review panel is  displayed for each proposal. </p>
<p>This is in the <strong>Call for Proposal</strong> sub menu of <strong>Projects</strong> menu - on opening which, </p>
<p>An  additional column will appear for &nbsp;&ldquo;<strong>Award</strong>&rdquo; link &nbsp;beside &ldquo;Proposal Review&rdquo; link &nbsp;(for site admin &amp; proposal  admin), immediately after the relevant reviewers complete and submit  evaluation for a proposal of a notification. </p>
<p>On clicking &ldquo;Award&rdquo; for an evaluated proposal ,  a new  page  opens where the proposal title, project title, institution and PI are  automatically populated. The project title and PI details can be editable (in  case of a scenario where PI/Project nature is changed. For e.g. if only a  component of the proposal is awarded a grant.)</p>
<p>In the Proposal List page, &ldquo;Award&rdquo; link is now  replaced by &ldquo;Awarded&rdquo;. On clicking &ldquo;Awarded&rdquo; the details can be viewed. </p>
<p>The first time a proposal is converted to  project in the above manner, the notification is converted to a project and  displayed in the Project List for that institution (which published the  notification). The awarded project is now listed out as a sub project for this  project. </p>
<p>The awarded project will also get automatically displayed in the Project List of the awardee (grantee). <br />
