<h2>External proposal submission in response to private notification </h2>
<p>Using this feature, an institute can submit proposals in response to notifications published privately by any other institute in the GMS network. </p>
<p>After logging in, click and expand the <strong>Project </strong>menu in the left navigation bar. Then click on sub menu<strong> Proposal Management </strong>. The <strong>Proposal List</strong> page opens. This section lists out all the  notifications published by  the other institutions in the GMS.</p>
<p>On this page, the interested  institution users (prospective grantees) can view </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Project name</strong> - the title of the grant opporunity according to the granting agency </li>
  <li><strong> Notification date</strong> - the date on which the granting agency published the notification within the GMS thereby the item appearing in all other user institution's Proposal List. </li>
  <li><strong>Grantor       institution&rsquo;s name</strong></li>
  <li><strong> Last date for submission of proposal</strong> - after which, proposal submission will be impossible as the button &quot;Apply&quot; will be disabled. </li>
  <li><strong>Notification details </strong>- View and download all files associated with the notification details</li>
  <li><strong>Status</strong> - status of submission (for the particular user's institution) - &quot;Submitted&quot; or &quot;Not submitted&quot; </li>
  <li><strong>Apply</strong> - Open and fill up application form required by the Granting agency. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the details are filled in the form, the user can &quot;Save&quot; draft without submitting it or submit it directly. In both cases, a Controller ID is generated and sent automatically to the user's email id. In case of &quot;Save&quot;d drafts, this controller id is requested each time the form needs to be opened. Once submitted, no further modification is possible. </p>
