<h1><a name="_Toc275266909" id="_Toc275266909">Project Creation</a> </h1>
<p>The site admin  can create new projects for the institution. The key associated activities are:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Saving the project details (which may be updated any       number of times) - project name, code, type, Principal Investigator,       Project Start &amp; End Dates.</li>
  <li>A project can have only a single Principal       Investigator at a time.</li>
  <li>The user may set a project as active/inactive as       appropriate in case of future changes in the programme. Thus system can       retain all the past data for a currently inactive project but not display       or involve it in the current activities &amp; reports, once the &ldquo;Inactive&rdquo;       selection is made. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc275266910" id="_Toc275266910">Add  PI</a> </h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The institution can assign any number of Co-PIs to       the project after project creation. </li>
  <li>The details       saved are &ndash; name and role (co-PI). </li>
  <li>The user may set a co-PI as active/inactive as       appropriate in case of future changes in the project team structure. Thus       system can retain all the past data for a currently inactive co-PI but not       display or involve it in the current activities &amp; reports, once the       &ldquo;Inactive&rdquo; selection is made. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc275266911" id="_Toc275266911">Add  department.</a> </h3>
<p>This is an  option for the institution to assign the created project to particular  departments. </p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The detail saved is the department name, selected       from the list of departments made available.</li>
  <li>Any number of departments may be associated with a       project.</li>
  <li>The user may set a department as active/inactive for       a project as appropriate in case of future changes. Thus system can retain       all the past data for a currently inactive project-department relationship       but not display or involve it in the current activities &amp; reports,       once the &ldquo;Inactive&rdquo; selection is made. </li>
  <li>Editing/updating may be done any number of times</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc275266912" id="_Toc275266912">Grant Allocation</a> </h3>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>While creating a project, a grant allocation is       created automatically with a default amount of zero. </li>
  <li>The site admin can update with the actual grant       amount the institution is allocating for the created project (self-fund).       Here, the Institution is the owner of the project. </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>The details saved are &ndash; amount allocated, and any       remarks from the user. </li>
  <li>Any number of grant allocations can be made during       the project period by the institution</li>
  <li>An allocation       can never be deleted. </li>
  <li>An allocation       cannot be edited after sub-project allocation </li>
</ul>
<p>For the  institution site admin (&amp; privileged users), there is provision to view all  its current projects in a single list , from which the&nbsp; user may navigate to any project&rsquo;s home page.</p>
