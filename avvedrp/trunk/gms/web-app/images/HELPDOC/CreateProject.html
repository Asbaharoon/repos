<h2 class="style1"><a name="_Toc275266909" id="_Toc275266909">Project Creation</a> </h2>
<p class="style1">The site admin  can create new projects for the institution. The key associated activities are:</p>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>Saving the project details (which may be updated any       number of times) - project name, code, type, Principal Investigator,       Project Start &amp; End Dates.</li>
  <li>A project can have only a single Principal       Investigator at a time.</li>
  <li>The user may set a project as active/inactive as       appropriate in case of future changes in the programme. Thus system can       retain all the past data for a currently inactive project but not display       or involve it in the current activities &amp; reports, once the &ldquo;Inactive&rdquo;       selection is made. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">On the left menu  panel, the administrator clicks on<em><strong> Projects </strong></em>menu on the left navigation bar. It expands  to display the sub menu &ndash; <strong><em>Create Project.</em></strong> <br />
On clicking <strong><em>Create Project</em></strong>, the page opens up where the main details are captured for saving the project - project name, code, project type, PI &amp; Project Start &amp; End Dates. </p>
<p class="style1">On clicking <strong>Create, </strong>the user is returned to the <em><strong>Project List </strong></em>with a message on top confirming successful creation of the new project and the new project name listed out in the <em><strong>Project List.</strong> </em> </p>
<p class="style1">On clicking the project name, the <em><strong>Project Info</strong></em> tab is opened to display the default <em><strong>Project Home </strong></em>page. Here the basic details captured are displayed. Further, on mouse roll over of the <em><strong>Project Info</strong></em> tab, further sub menus are displayed - namely <strong><em>Co-PI Addition</em></strong> &amp; <em><strong>Department Addition.</strong> </em></p>
<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<h3 class="style1"><a name="_Toc275266910" id="_Toc275266910">Add  Co-PI</a></h3>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>The institution can assign any number of Co-PIs to       the project after project creation. </li>
  <li>The details       saved are &ndash; name and role (co-PI). </li>
  <li>The user may add/delete co-PI as       appropriate in case of future changes in the project team structure. Thus       system  retains all the past data for a currently closed project. </li>
</ul>
<h3 class="style1"><a name="_Toc275266911" id="_Toc275266911">Add  department.</a> </h3>
<p class="style1">This is an  option for the institution to assign the created project to particular  departments. </p>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>The detail saved is the department name, selected       from the list of departments made available.</li>
  <li>Any number of departments may be associated with a       project.</li>
  <li>Editing/updating may be done any number of times</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="style1"><a name="_Toc275266912" id="_Toc275266912">Grant Allocation</a> </h3>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>While creating a project, a grant allocation is       created automatically with a default amount of zero. </li>
  <li>The site admin can update with the actual grant       amount the institution is allocating for the created project (self-fund).       Here, the Institution is the owner of the project. </li>
  <li>The details saved are &ndash; amount allocated, and any       remarks from the user. </li>
  <li>Any number of grant allocations can be made during       the project period by the institution </li>
  <li>An allocation       can never be deleted. </li>
  <li>An allocation       cannot be edited after sub-project allocation </li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">For the  institution site admin (&amp; privileged users), there is provision to view all  its current projects in a single list (<em><strong>Project List)</strong></em>, from which the&nbsp; user may navigate to any project&rsquo;s home page.</p>
<p class="style1">In case of a scenario where an institution has been sub allocated a project, the details will be captured by the grantor institution and the project is listed automatically in the <em><strong>Project List </strong></em>of the grantee. The grantee, in this case, has no privilege to modify the project details such as name, code, start &amp; end dates, PI etc. </p>
