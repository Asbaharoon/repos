<h2 class="style1">Fund transfer </h2>
<p class="style1">Fund transfer is  the record of actual cash flow from the grantor to the grantee. Fund transfer is recorded against the particular allocation. It is not necessary that the entire allocated amount be transferred to the grantee in a single transaction. Multiple fund transfers can be associated with a single allocation </p>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>Currently, the grantor institution can transfer funds       against each allocation to a grantee.</li>
  <li>Fund transfer is allowed only after  allocation has been done to account heads in the grantor's own institution. </li>
  <li>The details saved for a fund transfer are: amount       transferred and the date of transfer (by a grantor for a project assigned       to a grantee (recipient of the amount), against a grant allocation)</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>The amount mentioned as sub-allocated need not       entirely be transferred in a single fund transfer operation. Any number of       fund transfers may be made against a particular allocation.</li>
  <li>The amount transferred will be deducted from the accounts of grantor institution during calculation of Statement of Accounts. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc" class="style1">
  <li>The grantee should have a receipt against the fund       transferred. </li>
</ul>
<p class="style1">For a project selected from the <em><strong>Project List</strong></em>, click <em><strong>Allocation</strong></em> in the top row menu, and then sub-menu <em><strong>Sub Allocate Project</strong></em>. The <em><strong>Sub project Allotment</strong></em> page opens up. Here in the top half of the page, there is provision to record sub allocation from the current project. Below this, there is a table listing out details of existing sub projects. </p>
<p class="style1">For each line item here there is a link <em><strong>Fund Transfer</strong></em>. On clicking this, the <em><strong>Fund Transfer</strong></em> page is opened. The details below are captured:</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Amount Transferred:</strong></p>
