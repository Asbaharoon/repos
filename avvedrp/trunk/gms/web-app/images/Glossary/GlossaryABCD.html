  It a record of debit and credit entries to cover transactions involving a particular item or concern associates with the project. For e.g. Travel expense, personnel, office supplies etc.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Allocation </strong><br />
It is the official assignment of financial resources in an economic way. In GMS, there are 2 scenarios of allocation: </font></p>
<div align="justify">
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="style1" align="left">  The grantor allocating a bulk amount for a project to the grantee. </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="style1" align="left"> The allocation of amount amongst the various expense and related account heads associated with the project, within the organization (grantor's or grantee's).</font></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Approval Authority </b><br />
It is a review panel composed of experts who may or may not directly belong to the granting agencies and who review the grant applications to select eligible applications and reject others. They make funding recommendations to the granting agency. An approval authority may have one or more members, each of whom reads many  proposals during the review process, to collectively arrive at a shortlist and thereafter the final approved proposal. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In the following scenarios in GMS, approval authorities have a role:</font></p>
<div align="justify">
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="style1" align="left">  Internal evaluation of pre-proposals </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="style1" align="left"> Internal evaluation of full proposals </font></li>
    <li><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" class="style1" align="left"> External granting agency evaluation of submitted proposals</font></li>
  </ul>
</div>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Assign proposal to Approval Auhority </b><br />
Each pre-proposal and subsequent full proposal that is submitted by the staff in the institution is assigned to  teams of review members - approval authorities, to be evaluated, in a specific order.The pre-proposal details get populated for each member  of the approval authorities to whom the specific pre-proposal was assigned. Each evaluation level gets to review only after the previous level has completed. </font></p>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Attachment Type </b><br />
As the name suggests, this attribute helps the user mark a certain attached document as of a certain type (user defined), for future reference. For e.g. quarterly report can be an attachment type. So also, software license fee receipt. </font></p>

<p align="justify" class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Co-PI</b></font><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Co-PI is an individual involved with the PI in the scientific development or execution of a project. Currently in GMS, the co-investigator is assumed to be from the same institute as that doing the associated project. A co-investigator is considered &ldquo;key personnel.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Current Balance </font></strong><br />
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> (As displayed in Project Info screen)

<p align="justify" class="style1"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CV - Curriculum Vitae </font></strong><br />
  <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> A CV is a full account of a person's academic credentials and accomplishments. Granting agencies sometimes require a &quot;shortened CV&quot; of the proposed PI that lists only selected pieces of  scholarly history.</font></p>

<p align="justify" class="style1"><strong><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Department Code </font></strong><br />
    <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> In MGMS, Department code is intended to uniquely identify each department of the registered institution.  Currently the application would accept an arbitrary code which is familar to the user and display the code only in all relevant screens. Ideally, any coding system followed in the records of the particular institution can be implemented here.</font></p>
<p align="justify" class="style1"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Document Type </strong><br />
In MGMS, documents are uploaded in many modules for various purposes. To identify these attachments, categories have been used in the application - such as proposal, project, invoice etc called document types. Attachment types can be defined within these document types as per user's choice. </font></p>
