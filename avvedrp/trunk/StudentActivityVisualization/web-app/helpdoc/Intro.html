<p align="justify">Although generic LMS (Learning Management systems) are very 
  effective in facilitating the delivery of distance learning courses, they provide 
  very little help to instructors to gain understanding of cognitive and social 
  processes in distance classes. For example, questions like: .what level of mastery 
  on concept C has the student S achieved., or .did student S access the whole 
  course materials, and when. or .has student S participated to discussions regularly. 
  are diffcult to answer appropriately using conventional LMS.</p>
<p>A vast amount of data is collected by the LMS to keep a thorough record of 
  the students' activities in a distance course, but this is usually presented 
  in a complex tabular format, often incomprehensible and difficult to use by 
  instructors. Even worse, commonly there is no relationship between concepts 
  taught in a course and pages or quizzes created. As a result, instructors know 
  very little (sometimes even nothing) about what is happening in their distance 
  learning classes. Instructors may become confused or incapable of monitoring 
  the individual learning needs or the misconceptions of the distance students.</p>
<p>We wish to explore the use of Information Visualisation to render the data 
  collected from a LMS into an appropriate graphical manner. By applying visualization 
  programs, data from LMS can be presented in a format suitable for the instructors 
  to gain understanding of their learners and become aware of what is happening 
  in their classes. Unlike student models, students' data gathered from the LMS 
  is not processed by AI algorithms, but is processed and used to generate graphical 
  representations which may reveal facts, trends or situations with students. 
  With the representations produced by visualization techniques, information such 
  as .student S needs help because he is performing very badly at evaluation proofs. 
  are not suggested by a computer program, but can be inferred in the mind by 
  the instructors looking at graphical representations of the students performance 
  on quizzes.</p>
<p>We propose to build flexible student monitoring and tracking system for a generic 
  LMS where the information needed to build a student model is provided by the 
  log data of the students' activities collected by the LMS. This can be done 
  by representing LMS's activities and communications students have been engaged 
  in graphical representations.</p>
