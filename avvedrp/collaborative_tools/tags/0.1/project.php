  <p align="justify"><img src="images/project-computer.jpg" alt="Virtual Lab at Amrita" width="366" height="275" border="10" align="right" style="border-color:#FFF"/> <span>Intelligent development   of virtual laboratories with state-of-the-art computer simulation technology   to create real world environments and problem handling capabilities   is required to bridge the gap between institutions (or industries) that   retain the physical laboratory and distantly placed economically challenged   educational institutions.</span></p>
  <p align="justify"><br />
    A virtual laboratory   is a tool for distance learning and/or experimentation that allows people   to share knowledge, data, voice, video, tools, and many other resources.&nbsp;   It provides a suitable environment to&nbsp; extend, improve, integrate,   refine, and assist the learning and/or experimentation process of many   subjects, thus contributing to an increase of the effectiveness of scientific   research and widening the use of scarce or costly equipments. The diversity   of models and structures for virtual laboratories is large and varies   according to the nature of the project under investigation, the goals,   and the technologies involved. <br />
    <br />
    Amrita lab courses   richly rely upon new up-to-date content and various techniques that   require a new synergy of knowledge and experimental implementation.   Hence a new kind of experimental science that can be brought as a virtual   simulation based laboratory is proposed in this part of the proposal.&nbsp;   As key part of the project, the Biotech school will study and use mathematical   techniques in biology to study, hypothesize and demonstrate complex   biological functions. Other labs in biotechnology, physical and chemical   sciences, nanoscience are the major contributions from Amrita. Amrita   University jointly participates with IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay,   IIT Madras, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Guwahati, IIT Roorkee, IIIT Hyderabad   and Dayalbagh University.&nbsp; <br />
    <br />
    Although mathematics   has long been intertwined with the biological sciences, an explosive   synergy between biology and mathematics seems poised to enrich and extend   both fields greatly in the coming decades.&nbsp; Among the various scenarios   to study biology and disseminate information effectively and efficiently   include the use of e-learning to offer courses. However some challenges   include the lack of appropriate tools and content in certain advanced   courses like computational biology, theoretical neuroscience and some   other simpler courses like calculus for life sciences, advanced mathematics   for undergraduate and postgraduate students etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    <br />
    As part of the virtual   lab project pilot, a virtual neurophysiology lab has been developed   in the short period. Virtual neurophysiology techniques like brain slicing,   patch clamping, action potential in neurons, voltage and current clamp   protocols have been implemented via user-interactive animations and   through use of detailed mathematical simulators.&nbsp; In the area of   physical sciences, a set of simulators for various basic physics labs   such as DC circuit simulators, torsion pendulum simulator, tools for   demonstrating Faraday&rsquo;s law and Barkhausen effect, virtual optics   tools have been built. A basic chemistry lab is also being developed   as part of the pilot process. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
    <br />
    These experiments and   labs will be hosted for open access through the main project website <a href="http://vlab.co.in" target="_blank"><u>http://vlab.co.in</u></a> and at the university link <a href="http://sakshat.amrita.ac.in/VirtualLab/" target="_blank"><u>http://sakshat.amrita.ac.in/VirtualLab/</u></a>&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    This project is an   initiative of Ministry of Human Resource Department under National Mission   on Education through ICT.&nbsp; </p>
