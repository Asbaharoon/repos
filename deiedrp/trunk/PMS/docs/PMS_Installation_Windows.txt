   Password = superadmin (initial password), you can change this password after login.

KNOWN PROBLEMS--

1> When running ant init, if build failed and error shown is-
	"Error:-Can't Connect to MySQL Server on 'localhost'(10061)"
   Solution: - This problem comes when mysql server is not running.
	       One of the solution of this problem is to start the mysql 
	       Server using mysqld in c:\mysql\bin
	       Alternatively you can start the mysqlserver by clicking
	       'mysqladmin' exe file in the directory c:\mysql\bin 	  
     
2> When running ant init,if build failed and error shown is-
	"Error:-Java.sql.SQLException: Invalid authorization specification: 
	 Access denied for user: 'username'@ localhost (Using password yes)"
   Solution:-This problem comes because of the gap between @ and localhost.
	     For this kind of problems please check the build.properties file
             If there is any space left between databaseUser and
	     databasePasword variables. Remove that space from file. It will
	     Work fine.
