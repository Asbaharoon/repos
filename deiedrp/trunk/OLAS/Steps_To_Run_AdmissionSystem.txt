Note : Gwt compiler takes long to compile the files due to different permutation. but if you are 
not interested to wait long then there is a solution. But this solution works if you are sure
about the browser.
go to the file --> src/in/ac/dei/edrp/Admissionsystem.gwt.xml
append this line
<set-property name="user.agent" value="gecko1_8"/> 

after the line 

<extend-property name="locale" values="dummy"/>

The value gecko1_8 is for mozilla firefox
for internet explorer-6 value will be ie6
and for other browser surf the web ;)
