This document describes procedure to install CMS system on any Linux machine.

Installing CMS for linux
---------------------------------

Download the following

1. jdk-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm.bin or higher version from http://java.sun.com
2. apache-ant-1.8.2-bin.zip or higher version (apache-ant-1.8.2-bin.zip,apache-ant-1.8.0RC1) from http://ant.apache.org/
(Kindly notice the version)
3. download mysql from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
	MySQL-shared-5.1.54.0
	MySQl-server-5.1.54.0
	MySQL-client-5.1.54.0
	//MySQl-server: mysql-5.1.54-win32.msi or higher version 
4. download apache tomcat from http://tomcat.apache.org/
	apache-tomcat-6.0.20

Configuration Steps to be followed
-------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Login as root.
Step 2: Install JDK
	# chmod +x jdk-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm.bin
	# ./jdk-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm.bin

It will show licence, you should opt

	opt yes

One can also use jdk-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm for installing JDK using the following

	# rpm -ivh jdk-1_5_0_02-linux-i586-rpm

(Make sure no other installation of java exist in the path e.g., gcj (gnu
Cjava compiler). These are usually installed when the linux is installed.)


Step 3:	Install MYSQL

	# rpm -ivh MySQL-shared-5.1.54.0
	# rpm -ivh MySQl-server-5.1.54.0
	# rpm -ivh MySQL-client-5.1.54.0

Step 4: Install tomcat

	# tar -xzvf apache-tomcat-6.0.20.tar

Step 5: Install ant

	# unzip -a apache-ant-1.8.2-bin.tar.gz
	# cd apache-ant-1.8.2
	# chmod	+x bin/*

Step 6:	Update Environment Variable in .bashrc file in home
Directory. The following command should be
replicated in rc file to avoid typing them again when loging in next time.

   # JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk-1_5_0
   # ANT_HOME=/home/{user}/apache-ant-1.8.2
   # TOMCAT_HOME=/home/{user}/apache-tomcat-6.0.20
   # PATH=/usr/java/j2sdk-1_5_0/bin:/home/{user}/apache-ant-1.8.1/:/home/{user}/apache-tomcat-6.0.20:$PATH
   # export JAVA_HOME ANT_HOME TOMCAT_HOME PATH 

Note: Here {user} is the name of user home.


Step 7: Installing CMS 
I) Go into the webapps folder of apache-tomcat and make a folder name CMS. Now checkout the latest version     of CMS from this location into CMS folder
   ( https://course-management-system-public.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)

II)Create a folder named Flex_sdk in CMS/ and extract the Flex-SDK-ZIP/flex_sdk_3.2.0.3958A.zip into 'Flex_sdk'.

III). go to Flex_sdk\framework\flex_config.xml and make changes in the following lines-->

line no. 17 - change <target-player>9.0.124</target-player> to 
<target-player>10.2.0</target-player>

after line no 26 add line
 <locale-element>en_CM</locale-element>

line no 44 - <show-actionscript-warnings>false</show-actionscript-warnings>

line no 111 - <show-binding-warnings>false</show-binding-warnings>
line no 114 - <show-unused-type-selector-warnings>false</show-unused-type-selector-warnings>

line no 323 - <rsl-url>framework_3.2.0.3958.swz</rsl-url>
line no 325 - <rsl-url>framework_3.2.0.3958.swf</rsl-url>


IV). In the checkout version there is a folder named flex_sdk_content. Open this folder and there are two folders and one jar file --> locale, libs and flexTasks.jar.
copy locale/en_CM and paster in the  webapps\CMS\Flex_sdk\framework\locale\.
copy libs folder's all files and copy in webapps\CMS\Flex_sdk\framework\libs\
copy flexTasks.jar and replace the existing jar in Flex_sdk\ant\lib

If you are installing CMS first time-
1) Go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build folder and modify these lines of build.properties file 
according to your database setting-

databaseUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost/cms
database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cms
database.username=root
database.password=mysql

// next two line added by N K Singh IIT Kanpur
1.1) If your tomcat is not running on port 8080 then change the port number in  CMS_FLEX/locale/en_CM/Constants.properties 

1.2) Copy all file from Flex_sdk_content/libs and paste in Flex_sdk/frameworks/libs


2) Now go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build directory and type the command 
 # ant 
(if every thing is ok then message comes as Build successful..)

3) After that, type the following command to run the default Script-
 # ant createadminaccount
 
 
 If you have installed earlier version of CMS and want to update it-
  1) Go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build folder and ensure that these lines of build.properties file are just as
  according to your database setting-
 
  databaseUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost/cms
  database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
  database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cms
  database.username=root
  database.password=mysql
  
  2) Go to CMS\DatabaseChanges\ . There are files containing the database queries executed in each revision. If you find any file between your earlier revision and
  the latest revision then execute the queries from those files.
  
  3) Now go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build directory and type the command-
  # ant 
 (If every thing is ok then message comes as Build successful..)
  
  Note: You do not need to run 'ant createadminaccount' cammand in this case.

IX)Go into the bin directory of tomcat and execute this command for start the tomcat

# ./startup.sh

X) Now open your browser and type this url into the address bar
 	http://localhost:8080/CMS
   or http://IP address of your server:port number on which your tomcat is running/CMS

Default Login Details for First Installtion of CMS :
User Name: admin
Password   : admin
   
Note: mysql-connector.jar and jstl.jar should be inside lib folder of tomcat 

KNOWN PROBLEMS--

1> When running ant, if build failed and error shown is-
	"Error:-Can't Connect to MySQL Server on 'localhost'(10061)"
   Solution: - This problem comes when mysql server is not running.
	       One of the solution of this problem is to start the mysql 
	       	  
     
2> When running ant ,if build failed and error shown is-
	"Error:-Java.sql.SQLException: Invalid authorization specification: 
	 Access denied for user: 'username'@ localhost (Using password yes)"
   Solution:-This problem comes because of the gap between @ and localhost.
	     For this kind of problems please check the build.properties/databasesetting file in sqlMapConfig.setting in src folder.
             If there is any space left between databaseUser and
	     databasePasword variables. Remove that space from file. It will
	     Work fine.

3> when mxml failed related errors come it shows that there is some issue in the flex_sdk.. so kindly check it and recheck the version since it should be 3.2.0 with build 3958. Check the folder name it should be Flex_sdk and its path will be webapps\CMS\Flex_sdk
