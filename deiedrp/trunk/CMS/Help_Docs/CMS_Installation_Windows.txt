Step 6: Installing CMS 

i)	Go into the webapps folder of apache-tomcat and make a folder named as CMS and checkout the latest version of CMS from thislocation into newly created folder
	(https://course-management-system-public.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)





ii) Create a folder named Flex_sdk in CMS/ and extract the Flex-SDK-ZIP/flex_sdk_3.2.0.3958A.zip into 'Flex_sdk'.

iii). go to Flex_sdk\framework\flex_config.xml and make changes in the following lines-->

line no. 17 - change <target-player>9.0.124</target-player> to 
<target-player>10.2.0</target-player>

after line no 26 add line
 <locale-element>en_CM</locale-element>

iv). In the checkout version there is a folder named flex_sdk_content. Open this folder and there are two folders and one jar file --> locale, libs and flexTasks.jar.
copy locale/en_CM and paster in the  webapps\CMS\Flex_sdk\framework\locale\.
copy libs folder's all files and copy in webapps\CMS\Flex_sdk\framework\libs\
copy flexTasks.jar and replace the existing jar in Flex_sdk\ant\lib

If you are installing CMS first time-
1)Go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build folder and modify these lines of build.properties file 
according to your database setting-

databaseUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost/cms
database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cms
database.username=root
database.password=mysql


2) Now go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build directory and type the command-
 # ant 
(If every thing is ok then message comes as Build successful..)

3) After that, type the following command to run the default Script-
 # ant createadminaccount
 
 If you have installed earlier version of CMS and want to update it-
 1) Go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build folder and ensure that these lines of build.properties file are just as
 according to your database setting-

 databaseUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost/cms
 database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
 database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cms
 database.username=root
 database.password=mysql
 
 2) Go to CMS\DatabaseChanges\ . There are files containing the database queries executed in each revision. If you find any file between your earlier revision and
 the latest revision then execute the queries from those files.
 
 3) Now go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build directory and type the command-
 # ant 
(If every thing is ok then message comes as Build successful..)
 
 Note: You do not need to run 'ant createadminaccount' cammand in this case.


v) Go into the bin directory of tomcat and execute this command for start the tomcat

# ./startup.sh

vi) Now open your browser and type this url into the address bar
 	http://localhost:8080/CMS
  	Or 
	http://IP address of your server: port number on which your tomcat is   
  running/CMS

Default Login Details for First Installtion of CMS :
User Name: admin
Password:    admin
   
Note: mysql-connector.jar and jstl.jar should be inside lib folder of tomcat 

KNOWN PROBLEMS--

1> When running ant, if build failed and error shown is-
	"Error:-Can't Connect to MySQL Server on 'localhost'(10061)"
   Solution: - This problem comes when mysql server is not running.
	       One of the solution of this problem is to start the mysql 
	       Server using mysqld in c:\mysql\bin
	       Alternatively you can start the mysqlserver by clicking
	       'mysqladmin' exe file in the directory c:\mysql\bin 	  
     
2> When running ant ,if build failed and error shown is-
	"Error:-Java.sql.SQLException: Invalid authorization specification: 
	 Access denied for user: 'username'@ localhost (Using password yes)"
   Solution:-This problem comes because of the gap between @ and localhost.
	     For this kind of problems please check the build.properties/databasesetting file in sqlMapConfig.setting in src folder.
             If there is any space left between databaseUser and
	     databasePasword variables. Remove that space from file. It will
	     Work fine.
3> when mxml failed related errors come it shows that there is some issue in the flex_sdk.. so kindly check it and recheck the version since it should be 3.2.0 with build 3958. Check the folder name it should be Flex_sdk and its path will be webapps\CMS\Flex_sdk
