Step 6: Installing CMS 

i)	Go into the webapps folder of apache-tomcat and make a folder named as CMS and checkout the latest version of CMS from thislocation into newly created folder
	( https://cms-dei.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/)




ii) Go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build folder and modify these lines of build.properties file 
according to your database setting-



databaseUrl = jdbc:mysql://localhost/cms
database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/cms
database.username=root
database.password=mysql


iv) Now go into webapps\CMS\WEB-INF\build directory and type the command 
 # ant 
(if every thing is ok then message comes as Build successful..)




v) Go into the bin directory of tomcat and execute this command for start the tomcat

# ./startup.sh

vi) Now open your browser and type this url into the address bar
 	http://localhost:8080/CMS
  	Or 
	http://IP address of your server: port number on which your tomcat is   
  running/CMS

Now login as amir or deepak and see the magic ;)
   
Note: mysql-connector.jar and jstl.jar should be inside lib folder of tomcat 

KNOWN PROBLEMS--

1> When running ant, if build failed and error shown is-
	"Error:-Can't Connect to MySQL Server on 'localhost'(10061)"
   Solution: - This problem comes when mysql server is not running.
	       One of the solution of this problem is to start the mysql 
	       Server using mysqld in c:\mysql\bin
	       Alternatively you can start the mysqlserver by clicking
	       'mysqladmin' exe file in the directory c:\mysql\bin 	  
     
2> When running ant ,if build failed and error shown is-
	"Error:-Java.sql.SQLException: Invalid authorization specification: 
	 Access denied for user: 'username'@ localhost (Using password yes)"
   Solution:-This problem comes because of the gap between @ and localhost.
	     For this kind of problems please check the build.properties/databasesetting file in sqlMapConfig.setting in src folder.
             If there is any space left between databaseUser and
	     databasePasword variables. Remove that space from file. It will
	     Work fine.
